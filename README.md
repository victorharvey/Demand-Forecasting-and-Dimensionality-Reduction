### Risk management plan
*Potential risks, their likelihood, and how you plan to mitigate them if they become realised.* 

**Identified Risk 1:** This is an interesting problem that has no value.
**Likelihood:** High
**Mitigation:** Combine academic literature and business world case studies

**Identified Risk 2:** The output is not to academic standards.
**Likelihood:** High
**Mitigation:** Seek feedback from university on progress made
