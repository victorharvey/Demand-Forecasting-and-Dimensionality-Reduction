**Project Name:** Curse of dimensionality reduction in Demand Forecasting. \
**Description:** The aim of the project is to find real applicable models to reduce dimensionality and increase forecast accuracy \
**Owner:** Victor Harvey \
**Status:** Active \
**Updated:** December 2023 


## Description
### Project charter 
*An overview of the project, key elements and expectations.*

The project is part of my final project in my Master's in Data Science. It is using all elements of data science to offer a valuable contribution to society.

### Data
M5 Demand Forecasting Chellenge
"How much camping gear will one store sell each month in a year? To the uninitiated, calculating sales at this level may seem as difficult as predicting the weather. Both types of forecasting rely on science and historical data. While a wrong weather forecast may result in you carrying around an umbrella on a sunny day, inaccurate business forecasts could result in actual or opportunity losses."

### Risk management plan
*Potential risks, their likelihood, and how you plan to mitigate them if they become realised.* 

**Identified Risk 1:** This is an interesting problem that has no value.
**Likelihood:** High
**Mitigation:** Combine academic literature and business world case studies

**Identified Risk 2:** The output is not to academic standards.
**Likelihood:** High
**Mitigation:** Seek feedback from university on progress made
